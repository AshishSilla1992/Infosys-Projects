Microprocessor/MECA2 Dashboard Overview:
•	A microprocessor chip that is utilized in numerous controllers that touch almost every product John Deere produces will be 
obsoleted and the dashboard is aiding the program management team to work with the platforms to understand last time buy quantities 
which are planning to take place in 2022.  This dashboard has the potential to save the company 40 million in inventory as the team 
would have otherwise over bought to ensure enough inventory lasted for the life of the products the chip is being utilized in.

Data Connections
•	HANA VIEW: CA_MTRL_MM_LOCAL

1.	SharePoint Excel: Production PN's - this is the input list of part numbers that we use for the dashboards.
2.	SharePoint Excel: Service Only PN's- this is the input list of part numbers that we use for the ‘Service’ dashboards.
3.	SharePoint Excel: Platform Baseline - this is where we bring in platform and maybe a few other data fields.
4.	SharePoint Excel: Platform Overrides - this provides the list of ‘Plant+Material Number’ combinations for which we need to override the ‘old’ platform values from ‘Platform Baseline’ sheet to ‘New Platform’ values mentioned in this sheet and maybe a few other data fields.
